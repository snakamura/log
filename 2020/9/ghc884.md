# Installing GHC 8.8.4 and cabal-install to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

There're several ways to install any version of GHC to Ubuntu including using [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/), but one of the ways is to use [ppa:hvr/ghc](https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc) to install bare GHC and cabal-install.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hvr/ghc
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cabal-install-3.4 ghc-8.8.4
```

You may want to install `ghc-8.8.4-prof` package as well when you build your app with profiling enabled.
